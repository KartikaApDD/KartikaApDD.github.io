# ABOUT ME

---
My name is Kartika and I'm 15 years old now and I'm from Indonesia. I like do something that I find it's interisting activites. I have some hobbies too, my hobbies are make an art, cooking, and editing. I like to make a little animation when I have a free time. I can speak some languages too like Japanese and Balinese. I can speak Japanese just a little bit because I learnt it in my old school but still I'm not that good because I just remember about it a bit. Balinese language is the main language I should use to speak with my big family, Balinese languages is came from Bali (where I was born) but still I didn't that good when I decided to speak Balinese with my big family
## What I like to do
I like making an art but I can make an art just when I have my mood on because if I have no mood my art would looks really bad and that's why I didn't choose art this year even I like to drawing or painting because I don't want to hate one of my favourtie hobby. I like to cooking too because sometimes I help my mom in the kitchen. The last one is editing, I like to make a little animaiton when I have free times even it really hard but I still like to make an animation because it's fun, the best part is when I need to re-draw it.
## Why I choose digital technology this year?
I choose digital this year because of some reasons like I admiring my brother because he can made something that really interesting (like a web) and I think make some stuff like this kinda cool even it's really stressful for me because I still need to more learn about something like this.
## What I really want to make?
I reallly want to make a game that can really helpful for others and support all the kind of the phone. I want to be developer of a game and I hope I can.
## What my pass projects that I have made last year?
I have made Maori Pa for Math in tinkercad and made a 3d model (a key chain) with tinkercad.
